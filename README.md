# Headless CMS for personal portfolio
Uses bedrock (Wordpress) and a wpgraphql plugin to enable the Wordpress as a headless CMS.
Currently being used to manage (create, edit and delete) projects for my personal portfolio.
All routes except the graphql api endpoint and login / admin routes automatically redirect to a standardized json response.
